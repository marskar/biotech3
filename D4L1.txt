What is bioinformatics?
· DEFINITION
­ Inter-disciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics and engineering
· GOALS
­ Understand biological data
· DNA, RNA, protein sequences and/or structures
­ Solve biological problems
· Human disease, physiological traits

National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
· Portal to extensive database of resources
­ Analysis tools ­ BLAST ­ Sequence data ­ GenBank, GEO ­ Scientific literature ­ PubMed ­ Protein structures, Variation, etc

NCBI website
· http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

GenBank

Demo
· Search `gapdh' in GenBank
· Available information
­ Sequence, genomic context, tissue expression, linked articles, etc.

PubMed

Sequence Search
· Problem
­ Search for an unknown (query) sequence from a large database of genomes
· Tool
BLAST
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

BLAST workflow
· Choose appropriate BLAST program · Enter query sequence · Select database to search · Run BLAST search · Analyze output

NCBI BLAST

Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN)
Query Sequence Select Database

Protein BLAST (BLASTP)
Query Sequence Select Database

BLAST output
· Job summary

BLAST output
· Graphic summary
­ Color-coded based on scores ­ Mouse-over for more information

BLAST output
· Ranked alignments with scores
­ Higher scores = better alignment ­ Lower E-values = lower probability that alignment
was random chance

BLAST output
· Detailed alignments
­ Visual representation of alignment ­ Can include gaps or mismatches

Demo
· https://digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/sequences
· Copy and paste sequences into BLAST
­ Examine results

Multiple sequence alignment
· Alignment of three or more sequences to infer sequence homology and study evolutionary relationships
­ Protein, DNA or RNA
· Tool CLUSTAL
Cluster Analysis of Pairwise Alignments

CLUSTAL workflow
· Input sequences or upload file · Specify parameters · Run CLUSTAL · Analyze results

Clustal Omega
· http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/
Type of sequence Query Sequence or file

Clustal Omega Output
· Alignment

Symbol * : .

Meaning Fully conserved residue Strongly related residues Weakly related residues

Clustal Omega Output
· Alignment

Color Residues Red AVFPMILW Blue DE Magenta RK Green STYHCNGQ Grey Others

Properties Small (small+ hydrophobic (incl. aromatic -Y)) Acidic Basic Hydroxyl + sulfhydryl + amine + G Unusual amino acids

Clustal Omega Output
· Phylogenetic tree

Demo
· Download file:
­ http://www.bioinformaticsworld.com/clustal_seq.txt
· Go to Clustal Omega website
­ Run on downloaded file

Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
· Quantum leap of DNA sequencing technology · Ability to sequence whole genomes fast and
cheap · Large repository of public data
­ ENCODE project
· Tools to browse genomes and view data
­ UCSC genome browser

ENCODE project
· Encyclopedia of DNA elements
­ https://www.encodeproject.org/
· Launched in 2003 to identify all functional elements in human genome
­ Extended to mouse, worm, fly
· Massive consortium led by NHGRI

ENCODE project: Datasets
https://www.encodeproject.org/

ENCODE project: Assays
https://www.encodeproject.org/

UCSC Genome Browser
· Large public database of genome data
­ https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ­ Linked to many public
repositories, e.g. ENCODE
· Easy to use · Customizable view · Can upload your own data
(`custom tracks')
