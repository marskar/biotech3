# What is bioinformatics?
- DEFINITION
    - Inter-disciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics and engineering
- GOALS
    - Understand biological data
        - DNA, RNA, protein sequences and/or structures
    - Solve biological problems
        - Human disease, physiological traits

---

# National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
- Portal to extensive database of resources
    - Analysis tools - BLAST 
    - Sequence data - GenBank, GEO
    - Scientific literature - PubMed
    - Protein structures, Variation, etc

---

# NCBI website
- http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

---

# GenBank

![]()
---

# Demo
- Search `gapdh' in GenBank
- Available information
- Sequence, genomic context, tissue expression, linked articles, etc.

---

# PubMed

---

# Sequence Search
- Problem
- Search for an unknown (query) sequence from a large database of genomes
- Tool
BLAST
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool


---

# BLAST workflow
- Choose appropriate BLAST program 
- Enter query sequence
- Select database to search 
- Run BLAST search 
- Analyze output

---

# NCBI BLAST

---

# Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN)
Query Sequence Select Database

---

# Protein BLAST (BLASTP)
Query Sequence Select Database

---

# BLAST output
- Job summary

---

# BLAST output
- Graphic summary
- Color-coded based on scores 
  - Mouse-over for more information

---

# BLAST output
- Ranked alignments with scores
- Higher scores = better alignment 
- Lower E-values = lower probability that alignment
was random chance

---

# BLAST output
- Detailed alignments
- Visual representation of alignment 
- Can include gaps or mismatches

---

# Demo
- https://digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/sequences
- Copy and paste sequences into BLAST
- Examine results

---

# Multiple sequence alignment
- Alignment of three or more sequences to infer sequence homology and study evolutionary relationships
- Protein, DNA or RNA
- Tool CLUSTAL
Cluster Analysis of Pairwise Alignments

---

# CLUSTAL workflow
- Input sequences or upload file âˆ‘ Specify parameters âˆ‘ Run CLUSTAL âˆ‘ Analyze results

---

# Clustal Omega
- http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/
Type of sequence Query Sequence or file

---

# Clustal Omega Output
- Alignment

Symbol * : .

Meaning Fully conserved residue Strongly related residues Weakly related residues

---

# Clustal Omega Output
- Alignment

Color Residues Red AVFPMILW Blue DE Magenta RK Green STYHCNGQ Grey Others

Properties Small (small+ hydrophobic (incl. aromatic -Y)) Acidic Basic Hydroxyl + sulfhydryl + amine + G Unusual amino acids

---

# Clustal Omega Output
- Phylogenetic tree

---

# Demo
- Download file:
- http://www.bioinformaticsworld.com/clustal_seq.txt
- Go to Clustal Omega website
- Run on downloaded file

---

# Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
- Quantum leap of DNA sequencing technology 
- Ability to sequence whole genomes fast and cheap 
- Large repository of public data
- ENCODE project
- Tools to browse genomes and view data
- UCSC genome browser

---

# ENCODE project
- Encyclopedia of DNA elements
- https://www.encodeproject.org/
- Launched in 2003 to identify all functional elements in human genome
- Extended to mouse, worm, fly
- Massive consortium led by NHGRI

# UCSC Genome Browser
- Large public database of genome data
- https://genome.ucsc.edu/ - Linked to many public
repositories, e.g. ENCODE
- Easy to use 
- Customizable view 
-  Can upload your own data (`custom tracks')
