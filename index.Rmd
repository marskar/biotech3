# What is bioinformatics?
- DEFINITION
    - Inter-disciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics and engineering
- GOALS
    - Understand biological data
        - DNA, RNA, protein sequences and/or structures
    - Solve biological problems
        - Human disease, physiological traits

# National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
- Portal to extensive database of resources
    - Analysis tools ≠ BLAST 
    - Sequence data ≠ GenBank, GEO ≠ Scientific literature ≠ PubMed ≠ Protein structures, Variation, etc

# NCBI website
∑ http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

# GenBank

# Demo
∑ Search `gapdh' in GenBank
∑ Available information
≠ Sequence, genomic context, tissue expression, linked articles, etc.

# PubMed

# Sequence Search
∑ Problem
≠ Search for an unknown (query) sequence from a large database of genomes
∑ Tool
BLAST
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

# BLAST workflow
∑ Choose appropriate BLAST program ∑ Enter query sequence ∑ Select database to search ∑ Run BLAST search ∑ Analyze output

# NCBI BLAST

# Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN)
Query Sequence Select Database

# Protein BLAST (BLASTP)
Query Sequence Select Database

# BLAST output
- Job summary

# BLAST output
- Graphic summary
- Color-coded based on scores ≠ Mouse-over for more information

# BLAST output
- Ranked alignments with scores
- Higher scores = better alignment ≠ Lower E-values = lower probability that alignment
was random chance

# BLAST output
- Detailed alignments
- Visual representation of alignment ≠ Can include gaps or mismatches

# Demo
- https://digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/sequences
- Copy and paste sequences into BLAST
- Examine results

# Multiple sequence alignment
- Alignment of three or more sequences to infer sequence homology and study evolutionary relationships
- Protein, DNA or RNA
- Tool CLUSTAL
Cluster Analysis of Pairwise Alignments

# CLUSTAL workflow
- Input sequences or upload file ∑ Specify parameters ∑ Run CLUSTAL ∑ Analyze results

# Clustal Omega
- http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/
Type of sequence Query Sequence or file

# Clustal Omega Output
- Alignment

Symbol * : .

Meaning Fully conserved residue Strongly related residues Weakly related residues

# Clustal Omega Output
- Alignment

Color Residues Red AVFPMILW Blue DE Magenta RK Green STYHCNGQ Grey Others

Properties Small (small+ hydrophobic (incl. aromatic -Y)) Acidic Basic Hydroxyl + sulfhydryl + amine + G Unusual amino acids

# Clustal Omega Output
- Phylogenetic tree

# Demo
- Download file:
- http://www.bioinformaticsworld.com/clustal_seq.txt
- Go to Clustal Omega website
- Run on downloaded file

# Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
- Quantum leap of DNA sequencing technology ∑ Ability to sequence whole genomes fast and
cheap ∑ Large repository of public data
- ENCODE project
- Tools to browse genomes and view data
- UCSC genome browser

# ENCODE project
- Encyclopedia of DNA elements
- https://www.encodeproject.org/
- Launched in 2003 to identify all functional elements in human genome
- Extended to mouse, worm, fly
- Massive consortium led by NHGRI

# ENCODE project: Datasets
https://www.encodeproject.org/

# ENCODE project: Assays
https://www.encodeproject.org/

# UCSC Genome Browser
- Large public database of genome data
- https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ≠ Linked to many public
repositories, e.g. ENCODE
- Easy to use ∑ Customizable view ∑ Can upload your own data
(`custom tracks')

# UCSC Genome Browser
Mouse genome, mm9

Genomic location

Search box

Annotation
Conservation
Repeat elements
Additional options

# Annotation tracks

# ENCODE @ UCSC

# ENCODE @ UCSC
Tissues available
Transcription factors

# ENCODE @ UCSC
- Separate website with ENCODE data also available
https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/
Search human data
Search mouse data

# ENCODE @ UCSC
- Search full database for tracks to display

# Recap
- What is bioinformatics?
- NCBI portal ≠ GenBank, Pubmed
- Sequence analysis
- NCBI BLAST
- Multiple sequence alignment
- Clustal Omega
- Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
- UCSC Genome Browser ≠ ENCODE project
